## Contributing to the Repo

Follow some simple rules when contributing code or otherwise:
- Proper and full variable names (avoiding abbreviations is better where possible)
- Proper indentation and spacing
- Avoiding redundant code (Refactor code where possible)
- Comments where required (but making the code readable by variable names is also enough)
- Initial docstring for code files and documentation for functions
